GLOP Libraries

This is a collection of libraries that i use between my own projects. Each folder contains a different library.
You are welcome to try to use any single library but it is likely that you will have a little trouble as many are interdependant.
It is recomended to simply make the root folder here and then add the object file to you compilation step.

Example File
#include "glopLibs/imageLibrary/image.h"

int main(){
	Image im(100,100,PixelType::RGB);
	im.save("test.png",SAVE_TYPE::PNG,0);
	return 0;
}

Example Compilation
g++ main.cpp glopLibs/glopLibs.o -o ExampleProgram
